Composed of a mixture of cells and fluids, it plays a crucial role in maintaining vaginal health by providing lubrication, preventing infection, and removing dead cells. The characteristics of normal discharge can vary widely, ranging from clear and watery to white and thick, depending on factors such as menstrual cycle stage. However, abnormal discharge, often accompanied by unusual odor, color, consistency, itching, or pain, may indicate an underlying health issue."

This discomfort can originate from various organs within the reproductive, urinary, or digestive systems, as well as from the pelvic muscles and ligaments. The nature of the pain can vary widely, from sharp and sudden to dull and persistent. Intensity can range from mild to severe, and the pain may radiate to the lower back, hips, or thighs. Certain activities, such as urination or sexual intercourse, might exacerbate the pain. While some instances of pelvic discomfort are acute and short-lived, others can become chronic, persisting for six months or longer."
